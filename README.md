# JSCC18-Choices

## What?
Choices is a little game where you will do what you have to do a million times in a lifetime: Take choices!  
Some will be easy but others won't.

## How?
There will be two options given to the user from which he/she will choose one each round.  
He/she won't have a prior question to answer nor any other priming for his/her decision.  
It's just about the personal association with the given expressions.  
After answering a set the user will receive the next set (and is trapped in a loop forever :D).
